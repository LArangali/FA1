		<h1>Basketball rules:</h1>
		<h2>Rules for Everyone</h2>
		<h3>Although the foul rule is described above as a defensive rule, it applies exactly the same to all players on the court including offensive players.</h3>
		<h3>Basketball players cannot kick the ball or hit it with their fist.</h3>
		<h3>No player can touch the basketball while it is traveling downward towards the basket or if it is on the rim. This is called goaltending. (touching the ball on the rim is legal in some games).</h3>
