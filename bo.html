		<h1>Badminton</h1>
		<h1>Rules</h1>
		<h2>A player must wait until his opponent is ready before serving. If the opponent attempts a return then he is ruled having been ready.</h2>
		<h2>The feet of both players must remain in a stationary position until the serve is made. Your feet can not be touching the line at this time.</h2>
		<h2>It is not a fault if you miss the shuttle while serving.</h2>
		<h2>The shuttle cannot be caught and slung with the racket.</h2>
		<h2>A player cannot hold his racket near the net to ward off a downward stroke by his opponent or to interfere with his racket.</h2>
		<h2>Scoring System</h2>
		<h2>A match consists of the best of 3 games of 21 points.</h2>
		<h2>Every time there is a serve â€“ there is a point scored.</h2>
		<h2>The side winning a rally adds a point to its score.</h2>
		<h2>At 20 all, the side which gains a 2 point lead first, wins that game.</h2>
		<h2>At 29 all, the side scoring the 30th point, wins that game.</h2>
		<h2>The side winning a game serves first in the next game.</h2>
		<h1>Singles</h1>
		<h2>At the beginning of the game (0-0) and when the serverâ€™s score is even, the server serves from the right service court. When the serverâ€™s score is odd, the server serves from the left service court.</h2>
		<h2>If the server wins a rally, the server scores a point and then serves again from the alternate service court.</h1>
		<h2>If the receiver wins a rally, the receiver scores a point and becomes the new server. They serve from the appropriate service court â€“ left if their score is odd, and right if it is even.</h2>
		<h1>Double</h1>
		<h2>A side has only one â€˜setâ€™.</h2>
		<h2>The service passes consecutively to the players as shown in the diagram.</h2>
		<h2>At the beginning of the game and when the score is even, the server serves from the right service court. When it is odd, the server serves from the left court.</h2>
		<h2>If the serving side wins a rally, the serving side scores a point and the same server serves again from the alternate service court.</h2`>
		<h2>If the receiving side wins a rally, the receiving side scores a point. The receiving side becomes the new serving side.</h2>
		<h2>The players do not change their respective service courts until they win a point when their side is serving.</h2>
